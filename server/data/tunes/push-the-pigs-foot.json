  "chordsDescription": "This chart is based on the version by Bruce Molsky (checkout the audio below). The rhythm pattern on the guitar is pretty typical for this style of music. The simplest way to play this would be to just use a G chord the whole time. The C chords in the chart can be swapped out with G, though I think it's nice to keep the D chords in near the end of the phrases.",
