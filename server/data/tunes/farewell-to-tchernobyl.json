  "description": "This version is based on the playing of Gary Shannon and Karen Tweed. While I wasn't able to find a recording by it's author, Michael Ferry, he claims these two learned it by playing with him. It's also pretty common to hear verisons inspired by Sharon Shannon (see v11 at thesession.org).",
