  "description": "This transcription came from Hedningarna's self-titled album and translates to 'Bear Tune'. They play it in the key of E but I've transposed it here in the key of G (despite the misleading number of #s!). It uses a major scale with an augmented (raised) fourth which is common in Nordic music. There is a closely related tune called Björndansen, or 'Bear Dance'.",
